# QOTDbot
making a question of the day bot for discord

this is my first discord bot, so there may be some errors.

plans are to create a bot that posts different daily questions at a specified time, both questions that have been programmed into the bot's memory and custom submissions from users. staff should be able to approve or reject custom prompts made via UI
