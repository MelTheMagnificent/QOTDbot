# QOTDbot
making a question of the day bot for discord

this is my first discord bot, so there may (definitely will) be some errors.

plans are to create a bot that posts different daily questions at a specified time, both questions that have been programmed into the bot's memory and custom submissions from users. staff should be able to approve or reject custom prompts made via UI

questions- should be SFW and should never be reused. once the bot has asked a question from its memory base, it should never ask that question in the same server again.
